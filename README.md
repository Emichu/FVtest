## Form App

Project setup:
npm i
npm dev

Tech used
VSCode
Git
React
Typescript
NextJS
React Bootstrap

I used NextJS because it's simple and has everything I could need for this project.

I chose to use Reacts internal state hooks for simplicity

I used react bootstrap instead of styled components, as I am more familiar with it and it was simpler to use for this purpose.

I did not finish adding the logic to the next button as well as the proper validation, although the state potential is there.

If I were to try this project again, I would probably try to simplify the styling, so I can focus on the state/validation/backend side of it more.
