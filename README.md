## Form App

Project setup:
npm i
npm dev

Tech used
VSCode
Git
React
Typescript
NextJS
React Bootstrap
Formik
Yup

I used NextJS as it has all the tools needed for this project

I chose to use Reacts internal state hooks for simplicity

I used React Bootstrap instead of the styled components, mainly due to the simpler designs and usability. 
I believe styled components would be better to use in most other cases.

The next button currently has no functionality as there is no validation in the form, although the state is set.

There are several technologies I've seen that would be great with this project, such as Formik and Yup for form and validation. It would allow for better form handling and more complex validation.
I would have also liked to make more components reusable, as there is a lot of repeating code.
